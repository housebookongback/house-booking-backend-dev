## Review Management

The platform includes a comprehensive review system for properties:

- Guests can leave reviews for properties they've stayed at
- Hosts can respond to reviews
- Admin panel for managing all reviews with filtering and search capabilities
- Visibility control (publish/hide) for inappropriate content

To generate sample review data from completed bookings, run:

```bash
node generate-reviews.js
```

This will create realistic reviews for completed bookings, including host responses. The script handles the following:

- Creates guest reviews for properties (80% of completed bookings will have reviews)
- Adds host responses (70% of guest reviews will have responses)
- Creates host reviews of guests (60% of bookings with guest reviews)
- Updates host average ratings
- Sets realistic timestamps based on checkout dates

To access the review management in the admin panel, navigate to the Reviews section.
